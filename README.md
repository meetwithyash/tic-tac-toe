This is tic tac toe game developed using NodeJS + SocketIO. In which player have option to choose matrix size and winning count in the game.

I have applied Minimax algorithm on 3*3 board to make best move by system. But it is not efficient in greater board sizes, so I have implemented custom logic for making move for larger boards.
